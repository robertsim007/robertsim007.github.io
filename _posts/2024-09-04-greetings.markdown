Hello!

I'm a Computer Engineering major working on a Bachelor of Science degree at Wright State University. 
I'm pursuing a minor in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI).

I first received an Associate of Applied Science in Accounting at Clark State College in 05-2022.
Then I received an Associate of Science in Engineering Transfer at Sinclair Community College in 05-2024.

I am currently at Wright State University finishing my Bachelor's degree. I would love to continue on with a Master of Science in Computer Engineering or a Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science and Engineering. However, I'm not willing to fund this myself like with the prior two Associate degrees.
